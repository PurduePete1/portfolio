    <p>
      The circle represents unity and connection — at the center of everything I do in education.
      The diamond symbolizes strength and clarity — a reminder to lead with integrity, even under pressure.
      The four dots represent the people I serve: students, families, staff, and community. Together, they create a system worth protecting and nurturing.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not just a symbol — it's a daily reminder of why I lead, who I lead for, and the legacy I aim to leave behind.
