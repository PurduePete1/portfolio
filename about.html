  <h1 class="section-title">About Josh Watjen</h1>

  <p>
    With 19 years of experience in education and five years serving as both a classroom teacher and athletic director, I’ve worn just about every hat in the building—sometimes all in the same day.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently serve as the Athletic Director at Castle North Middle School, where I also teach sixth grade computer science. Over the years, I’ve taught sixth grade in self-contained, science, and technology-focused settings, with a brief detour into seventh-grade science. From launching new curriculum to managing game-day logistics, my work is driven by one core mission: supporting students in every way possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I became a teacher to be the person I once needed—to give kids a consistent source of encouragement, stability, and care. That "why" has never left me. It’s the same reason I’m pursuing educational leadership: to build schools where staff feel supported, families feel seen, and students are given the best shot at success.
  </p>

  <p>
    I thrive in the messy middle where logistics meet relationships. Whether it’s designing custom digital tools to streamline operations or stepping in to calm a chaotic hallway, I believe that good leaders are simply good servants with a vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy fixing electronics, tinkering with my Flipper Zero, playing video games, and building nerdy stuff that helps people. (And yes, I keep score at baseball games for fun.)
  </p>

  <p class="closing-line">
    I'm not just building systems—I'm building culture. And I’m here for the long game.
